# Multilinear-Analysis
Multilinear Analysis shows the correlation between independent variables of a dataset
Tha analyzed data is Students data.csv which aim is to predict tge GPA of students based on some independent variables
We can go ahead with the prediction like that but it might end up being overfitted. so avoid this i creted a multilinear analysis 
to help check for excess correlation between variables (independent) which i dropped afterwards, Check through the code for more.
